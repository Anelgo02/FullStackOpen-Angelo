  Note over User: User writes a note and clicks "Save"
  Note over User: spa.js prevents default form submit and updates UI optimistically

  User->>Server: POST /exampleapp/new_note_spa (JSON: new note)
  Server-->>User: 201 Created (JSON: confirmation or updated note)

  Note over User: SPA merges server response and keeps the list in sync
